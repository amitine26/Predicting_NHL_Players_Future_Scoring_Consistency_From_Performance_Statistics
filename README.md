Project Title: Predicting NHL Players’ Future Scoring Consistency From Performance Statistics

Project Description:

For my project, Predicting NHL Players’ Future Scoring Consistency From Performance Statistics, 
I developed a machine learning algorithm that predicts a player’s future offensive output, mainly 
the points they score in a 60 minute game, based on their underlying performance metrics. These 
performance metrics can include goals, assists, time-on-ice (TOI), Corsi, expected goals, hits, 
blocks, and special teams contributions. Understanding that traditional positions like (center, 
winger, defense) do not fully capture the specific roles of the player, I aggregated a dataset 
combining previous performance metrics mentioned above, and I used MoneyPuck as my data source. 
I performed a comparative analysis by training two distinct Random Forest models using historical 
data (2010 - 2023 seasons): one that incorporates K-Means clustering archetypes as features and one 
that does not. I validated these models against the true data from the 2024 - 2025 season to determine 
if unsupervised grouping reduces prediction error and better distinguishes sustainable skill from 
statistical luck. Finally, using the better performing model trained on all available data, I 
forecasted player performance for the current 2025 - 2026 season, providing projected point totals 
for both a 30-game span (approximately the current number of games played so far) and a full 82-game season.
